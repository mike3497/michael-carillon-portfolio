      <p class="mb-2">Hey, I am Michael Carillon.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        I am a passionate full-stack web developer based in Cleveland, OH.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        I got into web development after exploring video game development when I
        was younger. I attended The University of Akron majoring in Computer
        Information Systems. There I learned the basics of programming and used
        that knowledge to help me learn web development.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-2">
        In my spare time, I love to be with my fianc√©e Katherine and explore. We
        both love to travel and go to new places like museums, parks, and
        breweries.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have a 3 year old bluetick coonhound mix named Brutus who I love
        to go on hikes and walks with.
      </p>
